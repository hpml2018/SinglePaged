### Submission

We invite authors to submit original work to HPML. All papers will be peer reviewed and accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore. **Furthermore, a number of selected papers will be invited to a special issue of the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing (JPDC) - Elsevier.**

Submissions must be in English, limited to 8 pages in the IEEE conference format (see <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" style="color:blue">https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a> )

All submissions should be made electronically through the Easychair website ( <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hpml2018" style="color:blue">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hpml2018</a> ). 

At least one author who has a paper accepted must register for the conference - <a href="http://avalon.ens-lyon.fr/sbac-pad/" style="color:blue">IEEE SBAC-PAD 2018</a> - and attend the workshop to present their paper. Authors who do not register and present their paper, or arrange for a knowledgeable colleague to present it, will not have their paper published.
