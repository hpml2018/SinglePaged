### September 24, 2018, Lyon, France.

#### Held in conjunction with <a href="http://avalon.ens-lyon.fr/sbac-pad/">IEEE SBAC-PAD 2018</a>

### Overview

This workshop is intended to bring together the Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High
Performance Computing (HPC) communities. In recent years, much progress has
been made in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in general. This progress
required heavy use of high performance computers and accelerators.
Moreover, ML and AI have become a "killer application" for HPC and, consequently,
driven much research in this area. These facts point to an important
cross-fertilization that this workshop intends to nourish.

We invite researchers and professionals to take part in this workshop to discuss
the challenges of Machine Learning, AI and HPC, and share their insights, use
cases, tools and best practices.

HPML is held in conjunction with the 30th edition of SBAC-PAD. SBAC-PAD is
an international conference on High Performance Computing started in 1987
in which scientists and researchers present recent findings in the fields of
parallel processing, distributed computing and computer architecture.

**Proceedings will be published in IEEE Xplore. Furthermore, a number of selected papers
will be invited to a special issue of the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing (Elsevier - JPDC):**

### KEYNOTE SPEECH:

#### Title: Serendipity: How supercomputing technology is enabling a revolution in artificial intelligence

**Speaker: José E. Moreira, Distinguished Research Staff Member, IBM Research**

Abstract: With the availability of both large compute power and large data sets, we have witnessed a revolution in machine learning technology, which has become a mainstream tool for both business and scientific applications. This revolution is likely to accelerate, as even more compute power is brought to bear, and deliver many of the promises of artificial intelligence. In this talk we will investigate how far the impacts of machine learning can go. We will cover the new Summit supercomputer, which brings unprecedented compute capabilities to both traditional high performance computing and artificial intelligence problems, analyzing the similarities as well as the differences in those two fields. We will also speculate about the future of machine learning and, in particular, its possible limitations. We will conclude with a  discussion of one of the most important scientific questions of our time: Is consciousness computable?
