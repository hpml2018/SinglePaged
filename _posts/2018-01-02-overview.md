### HPML 2018 - Overview

This workshop is intended to bring together the Machine Learning (ML) and High
Performance Computing (HPC) communities. In recent years, much progress has
been made in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in general. One
of the drivers of this progress is high performance computers and accelerators.
Moreover, ML and AI has become the killer application for HPC and, consequently,
driven much research in this area. All this points to an important
cross-fertilization that this workshop intends to nourish.

We invite researchers and professionals to take part in this workshop to discuss
the challenges of Machine Learning, AI and HPC, and share their insights, use
cases, tools and best practices.
